# 10 Things You Will Eventually Learn About JavaScript Projects

## 1. Divide and conquer

### **Consistency**. It makes searching and dependency management significantly easier

### **Management**. Seperating each export into its own file allows you to quickly move it when necessary and promotes decoupling

## 2. Make things embarrasingly obvious

### Every variable, every function, every file - take your time and name them as if you were naming your newborn. Think ahead, and don't be afraid of long names

### Avoid hacks and things that make you think about applying to MIT straight away. Focus on making things simple, without a need for documentation or comments

## 3. Resolve magic numbers and strings

### No matter how small or non-extraordinary the value seems, put it into a variable with a meaningful name and move it to the top of its scope

### Any explicit value you put into the code wil be reused somewhere else. Put them in variables right away reduces code duplication, makes adjustments easier and gives these values a meaning

## 4. Fight nesting

### If your if-statement goes 3 levels deep - do your best to divide it. Dividing code within deeply nested if-statement into separate functions, Promises or Observables

## 5. Configure hard

### If your application uses global values, API endpoints, feature toggles or third-party credentials - put those in a separate config file. Your application will be available both on the server and locally for development

## 6. Frameworks are there to help

## 7. Unless it is a prototype - write tests

### With increasing complexity your codebase will become much harder to maintain and control - tests will do it for you

## 8. Use version control

### Use git or other version control from the very moment you write down the first line of code. Give meaningful commit messages

## 9 . Manage state responsibly

### Find a pattern or a library for state management and hang on to it like your life depend on it -  because at some point it just may

### As Frontend developers, we usually face only 2 significant challenges -  to display data and to store data

## 10. Question trends

### Listen and learn from the community - but consider and question everything you read, every moment, every lengthy article on Medium written by a cat, any feedback to your code, make sure you are not following the hype just to follow the hype
