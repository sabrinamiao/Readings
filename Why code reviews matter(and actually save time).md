# Why code reviews matter (and actually save time!)

## what exactly is a code review

### Code reviews should integrate with a team's existing process. This ensures the code reviewer's time is spent checking for things machines miss, and prevents poor coding decisions from polluting the main line of development

## What's in it for an agile team

### Code reviews share knowledge

### Code reviews make for better estimates

### Code reviews enable time off

### Code reviews mentor newer engineers

## But code reviews take time!

### Share the load

### Review before merging

### Use peer pressure to your advantage
