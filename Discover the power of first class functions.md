# Discover the power of first class functions

## In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be

## * stored in a variable, object, or array

## * passed as an argument to a function

## * returned from a function

### Storing a function

#### Functions can be stored in a variable, in an object and in an array

### Function as an argument

```doAction (function doSomething())```

#### A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

#### Higher order functions

#### A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an input, returns a function or does both

#### Some built-in methods that are higher-order functions: ```filter()```, ```map()```, ```reduce()```
