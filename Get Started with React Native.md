# Charpter 1 Getting Started with React Native

## React Native has built in components which are compiled to native UI components, while your JavaScript code is executed through a virtual machine. This makes React Native3 more performant than Cordova.

## Another advantage of React Native is its ability to access native device features.

## Expo allows you to build React Native apps without the initial headache that comes with setting up your development environment. It only requires you to have Node installed on your machine, and the Expo client app on your device or emulator.

## Expo is actually a platform that gives you access to tools, libraries and services for building Android and iOS apps faster with React Native.

## Expo comes with an SDK which includes most of the APIs you can ask for in a mobile app:

- Camera

- ImagePicker

- Facebook

- GoogleSignin

- Location

- MapView

- Permissions

- Push Notifications

- Video
